## Project Description
The Chemical Image Classifier (ChemIC) program is for training and using
a CNN model for classification chemical images into one of the four predefined classes:
1. images with single chemical structure;
2. images with chemical reactions; 
3. images multiple chemical structures; 
4. images with no chemical structures.


The package consists of three main components:
### A) Implementation of Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) (`chemic_train_eval.py`):
- Responsible for training a deep learning model to classify images into four predefined classes.
- Uses a pre-trained ResNet-50 model and includes data preparation, model training, evaluation, and testing steps.

### B) Web Service for Chemical Image Classification (`chemic/app.py`):
- Provides a Flask web application for classifying chemical images using the trained ResNet-50 model.
- Exposes an endpoint /classification for accepting chemical images and returning the predicted class.

### C) Image Classification Client (`client.py`):
- Interact with the ChemIC web-server. The client sends to server the path to an image file or directory with images, and the server classifies the images,
  providing the client with the recognition results.

## Requirements
* Flask>=3.0.0
* gunicorn>=21.2.0
* numpy>=1.26.3
* pandas>=2.2.0
* pillow>=10.2.0
* requests>=2.31.0
* scikit-learn>=1.3.2
* torch>=2.2.0
* torchmetrics>=1.2.1
* torchvision>=0.17.0

## Prepare Workspace Environment with Conda
```bash
# Create and activate conda environment
conda create --name chemic "python<3.12"
conda activate chemic
# Get and install package from Github repository
pip install git+https://github.com/ontochem/ChemIC.git

# Or install in the editable mode
git clone https://github.com/ontochem/ChemIC.git
cd ChemIC
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

## Model construction
Download the archive `dataset_for_image_classifier.zip` as a part of Supplementary materials from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/10546827) .
To perform model training, validation, and test steps as well as save your own trained model run:
```bash
python chemic_train_eval.py
```
Note, that the program should be run in the directory where the folder `dataset_for_image_classifier` is located.

## Models
Download pretrained models from Zenodo as archive [models.zip](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10709886) and unzip its content to the directory `models`.
The directory `models` should contain the pretrained model `chemical_image_classifier_resnet50.pth` for chemical image classification.

## Web Service for Chemical Image Classification
To start the Flask web server in production mode run in command line:
```bash
gunicorn -w 1 -b 127.0.0.1:5000 --timeout 3600 chemic.app:app
```
- -w 1: Specifies the number of worker processes. In this case, only one worker is used.
  Adjust this value based on your server's capabilities.
- -b 127.0.0.1:5000: Binds the application to the specified address and port. Change
  the address and port as needed.
- --timeout 3600: Sets the maximum allowed request processing time in seconds.
  Adjust this value based on your application's needs.

## Classify Image
```bash
 python client.py --image_path /path/to/images --export_dir /path/to/export
```
- **--image_path** is the path to the image file or directory for classification.
- **--export_dir** is the export directory for the results.

## Jupyter Notebook
The `client_image_classifier.ipynb` Jupyter notebook in folder `notebooks` provides an easy-to-use interface for classifying images.
Follow the outlined steps to perform image classification.
